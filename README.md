- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
    To interpret user needs and implement them into a program a few tools can be used. User stories are one of the tools you can use to collect user data and needs. Interpreting user needs will start with the analysis of the system. Asking for feedback is a good way of doing this. Errors should be pointed out and inputs and outputs shound be identified.

    User stories can be used to express a user's needs. Agile uses this tool. User stories help us implement what the user wants and needs so we can creater a description for them.
  
- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Agile offers more flexibility and using more testing throughout the process.
